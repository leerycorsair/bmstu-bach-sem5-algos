1. Doomed

Cut off my wings and come lock me up
Just pull the plug yeah, I've had enough
Tear me to pieces, sell me for parts
You're all vampires so here

You can have my heart (my heart, my heart...)
You can have my heart (my heart, my heart...)
You can have my heart (my heart, my heart...)

The world's a funeral, I run with ghosts
No hint of movement, no sign of pulse
Only an echo, just skin and bone
They kick the chair but we, we help tie the rope

(My heart, my heart...)
You can have my heart (my heart, my heart...)
You can have my heart (my heart, my heart...)
You can have my heart (my heart, my heart...)

So come rain on my parade
'Cause I want to feel it
Come shove me over the edge
'Cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry but it's too late
And it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade
I think we're doomed, I think we're doomed
And there is no way back

You must've made some kind of mistake
I asked for death, but instead I'm awake
The devil told me "No room for cheats"
I thought I sold my soul, but he kept the receipt

So leave the lights on, I’m coming home
It's getting darker but I carry on
The sun don't shine here, it never did
And when it rains, it fucking pours
But I think I like it
And you know that I'm in love with the pain
I think I like it

So come rain on my parade
'Cause I want to feel it
Come shove me over the edge
'Cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry but it's too late
And it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade

I think we're doomed, I think we're doomed
And there is no way back

I think we're doomed, I think we're doomed
And there is no way back

So come rain on my parade
'Cause I want to feel it
Come show me over the edge
'Cause my head is in overdrive
I'm sorry but it's too late
And it's not worth saving
So come rain on my parade

I think we're doomed, I think we're doomed
And there is no way back

2. Happy Song

I’ve had enough
There’s a voice in my head
Says I’m better off dead
But if I sing along
A little fucking louder to a happy song
I’ll be alright
You want to give up
Gave it all that you got
And it still doesn’t cut
But if you sing along
A little fucking louder to a happy song
You’ll be just fine cos’

Every now and again we get that feeling
And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel
& I’m going round in circles
Going round in circles.

We are possessed
We’re all fucked in the head
Alone & depressed

But if we sing along
A little fucking louder
To a happy song
Maybe we’ll forget cos'

Every now and again we get that feeling
And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel
And I'm going round in circles

Don’t wake us up
We’d rather just keep dreaming
Cos' the nightmares in our heads are bad enough
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel
& I’m going round in circles
Going round in circles

The world has coalesced
Into one giant mess
Of hate & unrest
So let’s all sing along
A little god damn louder
To a happy song
And pretend it’s all ok
That’s the spirit.


3. Throne

Remember the moment you left me alone and
Broke every promise you ever made
I was an ocean, lost in the open
Nothing could take the pain away

So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne

The sticks and the stones that
You used to throw have
Built me an empire
So don’t even try
To cry me a river
Cause I forgive you
You are the reason I still fight

So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne

So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne

I’ll leave you choking
On every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you’ve broken
And now you know
I’ll leave you choking
On every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you’ve broken
And now you know
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne

So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne


4. True Friends

I wouldn’t hold my breath if I was you
Cause' I’ll forget but I’ll never forgive you
Don’t you know, don’t you know?
True friends stab you in the front

It’s funny how things work out
Such a bitter irony
Like a kick right to the teeth
It fell apart right from the start
But I couldn’t even see the forest for the trees
(I’m afraid you asked for this)

You got a lot of nerve but not a lot of spine
You made your bed when you worried about mine
This ends now

I wouldn’t hold my breath if I was you
Cause I’ll forget but I’ll never forgive you
Don’t you know, don’t you know?
True friends stab you in the front
I wouldn’t hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart & there’s nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front

It’s kind of sad cause what we had
Well it could have been something
I guess it wasn't meant to be
So how dare you try and steal my flame
Just cause yours faded
Well hate is gasoline
A fire fuelling all my dreams
(I’m afraid you asked for this)

You got a lot of nerve but not a lot of spine
You made your bed when you worried about mine
This ends now

I wouldn’t hold my breath if I was you
Cause I’ll forget but I’ll never forgive you
Don’t you know, don’t you know?
True friends stab you in the front
I wouldn’t hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart & there’s nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front

You can run but you can’t hide
Time won’t help you
Cause karma has no deadline
You can run but you can’t hide
Time won’t help you
Cause karma has no deadline

I wouldn’t hold my breath if I was you
Cause I’ll forget but I’ll never forgive you
Don’t you know, don’t you know?
True friends stab you in the front
I wouldn’t hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart & there’s nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front

And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front


5. Follow You

My head is haunting me and my heart feels like a ghost.
I need to feel something 'cause I’m still so far from home.

Cross your heart and hope to die,
Promise me you’ll never leave my side.

Show me what I can’t see when the spark in my eyes is gone.
You got me on my knees, I’m your one man cult.

Cross my heart and hope to die.
Promise you I’ll never leave your side.

'Cause I’m telling you, you’re all I need.
I promise you, you’re all I see,
'Cause I’m telling you, you’re all I need.
I’ll never leave.

So you can drag me through hell,
If it meant I could hold your hand.
I will follow you, 'cause I’m under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames,
I will follow you.
I will follow you.

Come sink into me and let me breathe you in.
I’ll be your gravity, you be my oxygen,

So dig two graves 'cause when you die,
I swear I’ll be leaving by your side.

So you can drag me through Hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you cause I'm under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames

I will follow you so you can drag me through Hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you cause I'm under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames
I will follow you, I will follow you
I will follow you, I will follow you

So you can drag me through Hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you cause I'm under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames
I will follow you, I will follow you


6. What You Need

You’re hypnotized, can’t see the signs,
I’d like to help you, but I think it’s too late.
Made up your mind and now you’re blind,
I guess it’s easier than making mistakes.

Don’t ask me why to roll your eyes at the answer
You want to fight but I won’t bite on the bait.
And I’m not trying to change
Your eyes so don’t panic 'cause I’m not selling

So don’t tell me what I can't see,
'cause we both know it’s you not me.
You don’t want this, but it’s what you need
And you’ll see it when you believe.

You'll see it, you'll see it
You'll see it when you believe
You'll see it, you'll see it
And you'll see it when you believe

Give me a break, 'cause I can’t take
Another second, you’re a fucking headache.
I ain’t got time to change your mind,
How can I move you when you’re stuck in your ways?

Don’t ask me why to roll your eyes at the answer
You want to fight but I won’t bite on the bait.
And I’m not trying to change
Your eyes so don’t panic
I'm just saying, no I'm just saying

Don't come crawling back to me when you break down
Cause you dug yourself into this hole all by yourself
Don't come crawling back to me when you break down
You can find somebody else...

So don't tell me what I can't see
Cause we both know it's you, not me
You don't want this but it's what you need
And you'll see it when you believe

So don't tell me what I can't see
Cause we both know it's you, not me
You don't want this but it's what you need
And you'll see it when you believe

You'll see it, you'll see it
You'll see it when you believe
You'll see it, you'll see it
You'll see it when you believe

Yeah, hell yeah. You make me wanna slit my wrists & play in my own blood.
Yeah, hell yeah. You make me wanna kill myself just for the fucking fun.

Yeah, hell yeah
You make me want to slit my wrists and play in my own blood
Yeah, hell yeah
You make me want to kill myself just for the fucking fun

So don't tell me what I can't see
Cause we both know it's you, not me
You don't want this but it's what you need
And you'll see it when you believe
And you'll see it when you believe


7. Avalanche

Cut me open and tell me what’s inside.
Diagnose me 'cause I can’t keep wondering why.
And no, it’s not a phase 'cause it happens all the time.
Start over, check again, now tell me what you find.

'Cause I’m going out of frequency.
Can anyone respond?

It’s like an avalanche,
I feel myself go under,
'Cause the weight of it’s like hands around my neck.
I never stood a chance,
My heart is frozen over,
And I feel like I am treading on thin ice.

Am I broken? What’s the chance I will survive?
Don’t sugarcoat me, 'cause I feel like suicide.
Just give it to me straight 'cause I’m running out of time.
I need an antidote, now what can you prescribe?

It's like an avalanche
I feel myself go under
'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance
My heart is frozen over
And I feel like I am treading on thin ice

And I’m going under.

I need a cure for me,
'Cause a square doesn’t fit the circle.
Give me a remedy,
'Cause my head wasn’t wired for this world.

I need a cure for me
'Cause a square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy
'Cause my head wasn't wired for this world

'Cause I'm going out of frequency
Can anyone respond?
'Cause I'm going out of frequency
Can anyone respond?

It's like an avalanche
I feel myself go under
'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance
My heart is frozen over
And I feel like I am treading on thin ice

And I'm going under

I need a cure for me
'Cause a square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy
'Cause my head wasn't wired for this world

I need a cure for me
'Cause a square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy
'Cause when it hits, well it hits like an avalanche.


8. Run

My heart’s a hieroglyph, it talks in tongues.
Ten thousand voices fill my broken lungs. But through the white
Wave I still hear it call. So take a deep breath, let’s disappear.
No – one will miss us, so why are we still here? And in the black
Hole you will see it all.

'cause this is not enough and I won’t wait for them to cut me up. So
Give me all you’ve got, they’ll never stop until they see it fall,
So let’s run.

Your head’s a hurricane, it moves in wave. A perfect storm that
Keeps you wide awake. But through the silence you will feel
It burn. So take my hand and let’s fade away. You know there’s
Nothing here to make us stay. And in the darkness you will see
The sun.

So let’s run away, 'cause everything’s broken and we’re so much
More than another brick in the grey. So give it your every, give
Me your everything and let’s get away, 'cause everything’s broken,
I know that we’re more than another brick in the grey. So give it
Your every. Give me your everything.


9. Drown

What doesn't kill you, makes you wish you were dead.
Got a hole in my soul, growing deeper and deeper.
And I can't take one more moment of this silence.
The loneliness is haunting me.
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up.

It comes in waves, I close my eyes.
Hold my breath and let it bury me.
I'm not okay, and it's not alright.
Won't you tread the lake and bring me home again?

Who will fix me now? Dive in when I'm down?
Save me from myself, don't let me drown.
Who will make me fine? Drag me out alive.
Save me from myself, don't let me drown.

What doesn't destroy you, leaves you broken instead.
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper.
And I can't take one more moment of this silence.
The loneliness is haunting me.
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up.

It comes in waves, I close my eyes.
Hold my breath and let it bury me.
I'm not okay, and it's not alright
Won't you tread the lake and bring me home again?

Who will fix me now? Dive in when I'm down?
Save me from myself, don't let me drown.
Who will make me fine? Drag me out alive.
Save me from myself, don't let me drown.

'Cuz you know that I can't do this on my own. Who will fix me now?
Who will fix me now?
Who will fix me now? Dive in when I'm down?
Save me from myself, don't let me drown.


10. Blasphemy

Ask no questions and you’ll get no lies. Turn the cheek and blind
The eye (let it go). Bend the knee and give away your life. Bite
Your tongue and close your mind (never know).

It makes no sense but it must be right, the blood and sweat you
Sacrificed. Was it all for nothing? 'cause we’ve found no sign and
We’ve seen no light, we hear no voice when we pray at night but
We swore and now it’s too late to turn back.

You’re not blessed, you’re cursed and it’s getting worse now.

You’ve got hell to pay, but you already sold your soul. It’s
Blasphemy, but the words don’t make sense no more. What would
Your mother say? Your has immured. So don’t try and
Tell me that you still believe, no don’t preach to me.


11. Oh No

You don't have to lie I know exactly where you’ve been. 'cause you’re chewing
Off my ear while you’re chewing on your chin.

No we’re not on the level, you’re just off your face. It’s not a state of
Mind no, your head’s just in a state. I may be on the outside but you’re
Empty within. It’s getting kind of old now, I think it’s time to pack it in.

Don’t call it a party, 'cause it never stops. Now one is too many but it’s never
Enough. Don’t tell me you’re happy, 'cause this isn’t love, so be careful what
You wish for.

Who you trying to fool? You know you’re in over your head. 'cause you’re
Holding onto heaven but you’re hanging by a thread.

Oh no.

1. Can You Feel My Heart

Can you hear the silence?
Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken?
Can you feel... can you feel my heart?

Can you help the hopeless?
While, I'm begging on my knees
Can you save my bastard soul?
Will you weep for me?

I'm sorry brothers
So sorry lover
Forgive me father
I love you, mother

Can you hear the silence?
Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken?
Can you feel my heart?

Can you feel my heart?
Can you feel my heart?
Can you feel my heart?

I'm scared to get close and I hate being alone
I long for that feeling to not feel at all
The higher I get, the lower I sink
I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim

I'm scared to get close and I hate being alone
I long for that feeling to not feel at all
The higher I get, the lower I sink
I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim

I'm scared to get close and I hate being alone
I long for that feeling to not feel at all
The higher I get, the lower I sink
I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim

Can you feel my heart?

Can you hear the silence?
Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken?
Can you feel... can you feel my heart?


2. The House Of Wolves

Show me a sign, show me a reason to give
A solitary fuck about your god damn beliefs
I'm going blind, but one thing's clear
Death is the only salvation you'll feel

Brick by brick by brick...
Brick by brick by brick...

What you call faith, I call a sorry excuse
Cloak and daggers murder the truth
A bitter taste, there's nothing else
I'll bow for your king when he shows himself

Brick by brick by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Is burning a thousand suns

Show me your face, show me a reason to think
My soul can't be saved if I sell you my sins
I'm going blind, but one thing's clear
Death is the only salvation for me

Brick by brick by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Is burning a thousand suns

(The house of wolves you built)
(The nest of wolves you built)

The house of wolves you built
Will burn just like a thousand suns

So when you die, the only kingdom you'll see—
Is two-foot wide and six feet deep!

Yeah!

And when you die, the only kingdom you'll see—
Is two-foot wide and six feet deep!

And when you die, the only kingdom you'll see—
Is two-foot wide and six feet deep!

Brick by brick by brick...
Brick by brick by brick...

Brick by brick by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Is burning a thousand suns

Brick by brick by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Will burn just like a thousand suns

You said you want me?
Now I'm here, now I'm here, now I'm here!
You said you want me?
Now I'm here, now I'm here, now I'm here!


3. Empire (Let Them Sing)

It's the start of the end
Surrender the throne
The blood on my hands covered the holes

We've been surrounded, by vicious cycles
Are we truly alone?
Discover your heart, yours to atone
We've been surrounded
Let 'em sing, let 'em sing!

The deeper you dig, the darker it gets
There's nowhere else for us to go
We live while we learn, and then we forget
We'll never find our way back home
Come on!

They came like moths to a flame
You live like a house in a hurricane

(The wolves are at my door)

It's the start of the end
Surrender the throne
The blood on my hands covered the holes

We've been surrounded, by vicious cycles
The end, and we're truly alone
The scars on your heart are yours to atone
We've been surrounded
Let 'em sing, let 'em sing!

I hear them calling at the gates
(Let us in, let us in)
I hear them calling out my name
(I don't care)

Let them sing, let them sing, let them sing
Let the bastards sing
Let them sing, let them sing
Let the bastards sing
Let them sing, let them sing
Let the bastards sing
Let the God-forsaken bastards sing

They came like moths, to a flame
You live like a house in a hurricane

The wolves are at my door
But I can see the writing on the walls
The wolves are at my door
Waiting for my empire to fall

It's the start of the end
Surrender the throne
The blood on my hands covered the holes

We've been surrounded, by vicious cycles
Sp call it the end, and we're truly alone
The scars on your heart are yours to atone
We've been surrounded
Let 'em sing, let 'em sing!


4. Sleepwalking

My secrets are buried now
From my heart and my bones catch a fever
When it cuts you up this deep
It's hard to find a way to breathe

Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper
Shadows start to see
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe

Time stood still
The way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking

I'm at the edge of the world
Where do I go from here?
Do I disappear?
Edge of the world
Should I sink or swim?
Or simply disappear?

Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper
Shadows start to see
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe

Seeing as time stood still
The way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking

Wake up!
Take my hand and
Give me a reason to start again
Wake up!
Pull me out and
Give me a reason to start again

Time stands still
(Time stands still)
Time stands still
(Time stands still)

Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper
Shadows start to see
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe

Time stood still
The way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking
(It's like I'm sleepwalking)
(It's like I'm sleepwalking)
(It's like I'm sleepwalking)

Time stood still
The way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking


5. Go To Hell, For Heaven's Sake

For the love of god, will you bite your tongue
Before we make you swallow it
It's moments like this where silence is golden
(And then you speak)

No one wants to hear you
No one wants to see you
So desperate and pathetic
I'm begging you to spare me
The pleasure of your company

(When did the diamonds leave your bones?)

I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm leaving out every word you said
Go to hell for heaven's sake

I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm leaving out every word you said
Go to hell for heaven's sake

(Go to hell for heaven's sake)

No one wants to hear you (Save your breath)
No one wants to see you
So desperate and pathetic
You think that no one sees this
I think it's time you knew the truth

I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm leaving out every word you said
Go to hell for heaven's sake

I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm leaving out every word you said
Go to hell for heaven's sake

When did the diamonds leave your bones
Leave your bones

You're not a shepherd, you're just a sheep
I'll cut my depths of everyone you meet
Your own flesh with no bones
Feed them to the sharks
And throw them to the walls

I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm leaving out every word you said
Go to hell for heaven's sake

I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm leaving out every word you said
Go to hell for heaven's sake

Go to to hell for heaven's sake
Go to to hell for heaven's sake
Go to to hell for heaven's sake


6. Shadow Moses

Can you tell from the look in our eyes?
We're going nowhere
We live our lives like we're ready to die
We're going nowhere

Can you tell from the look in our eyes?
We're going nowhere
We live our lives like we're ready to die
We're going no where

I thought I'd buried you
And covered the tracks
You'll have to take this with your cold dead hands
I thought I'd buried you
Where sin can never die

I thought I cut you loose
Severed the feeling
I stepped through the crack as you clamp to my shirt
I thought I'd buried you
Where sin can never die

FUCK!

Can you tell from the look in our eyes,
We're going nowhere
We live our life like we're ready to die,
We're going nowhere

You can run but you'll never escape,
Over and over again
Will we ever see the end?
We're going nowhere

THIS IS SEMPITERNAL!

Will we ever see the end?
This is sempiternal
Over and over
Again and again

Rise from the dead you say,
Secrets don't sleep till they're took to the grave,
Signal the sirens,
Rally the troops,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It's the moment of truth

Can you tell from the look in our eyes?
We're going nowhere
We live our lives like we're ready to die,
We're going nowhere

You can run but you'll never escape,
Over and over again
Will we ever see the end?
We're going nowhere
[x2]

THIS IS SEMPITERNAL!

Will we ever see the end?
This is sempiternal
Over and over
Again and again


7. And The Snakes Start To Sing

I've lost the plot again. Tell your friends to sharpen their teeth.
There's a few quid to be made.
And my soul's a sorry state, so come on down you empty lovers.
 
Worms come out of the woodwork, and the snakes start to sing.

Do you feel the chill clawing at the back of your neck?
I start to spill.
Did you really think that you could fix me?
They'll sell their bones for another roll.
 
Well sharpen your teeth.
Tell yourself that it's just business.

Worms come out of the woodwork.
Leeches crawl from out of the dirt.
Rats climb out of the holes they call home.
I fall apart; and the snakes start to sing.

Don't say I'm better off dead,
'Cause heaven's full and hell won't have me
Won't you make some room in your bed?
Well you could lock me up in your heart,
And throw away the key
Won't you take me out of my head?

I'm just a would've been, could've been, should've been,
Never was and never ever will be
Well sharpen your teeth
Tell yourself that it's just business

Would've been, could've been, should've been,
Never was and never ever will be

Worms come out of the woodwork, and the snakes start to sing

Worms come out of the woodwork.
Leeches crawl from out of the dirt.
Rats climb out of the holes they call home.
I fall apart; and the snakes start to sing.

If you can't soar with the eagles,
Then don't fly with the flock
Are you still getting high?
Did you catch your own reflection
In the knife my mother held?
Or the hell in my father's eyes?

If you can't soar with the eagles,
Then don't fly with the flock
Are you still getting by?
Was I your knight in shining armour?
The apple of your eye?
Or just a step to climb?

If you can't soar with the eagles,
Then don't fly with the flock
Are you still getting high?
Did you catch your own reflection,
In the knife my mother held?
Or the hell in my father's eyes?

If you can't soar with the eagles,
Then don't fly with the flock
Are you still getting by?
Was I your knight in shining armour?
Or the apple of your eye?
Or just a step, a fucking step to climb!


8. Seen It All Before

Every second's soaked in sadness
Every weekend is a war
And I'm drowning in the déja vu
We've seen it all before

I don't wanna do this by myself
I don't wanna live like a broken record
I've heard these lines a thousand times
And I've seen it all before

Are we close enough?
There is something I must confide
I think we've lost our touch
There's no sparkle in those eyes

What an awful mess I've made
There's nothing left to save

Every second's soaked in sadness
Every weekend is a war
And I'm drowning in the déja vu
We've seen it all before

I don't wanna do this by myself
I don't wanna live like a broken record
I've heard these lines a thousand times
And I've seen it all before

(There's nothing in the air tonight...)

Every second's soaked in sadness
Every weekend is a war
And I'm drowning in the déja vu
We've seen it all before

I don't wanna do this by myself
I don't wanna live like a broken record
I've heard these lines a thousand times
And I've seen it all before

I'm sorry, no... it's not enough
We shouldn't feel a love so painfully
It hurts right to the touch
I know it stings, I know this cuts
And I wish I could agree with you
But fuck this love, it's not enough

It's not enough...
It's not enough...


9. Anti-Vist

Middle fingers up, if you don't give a fuck!
I'm sick to death of swallowing, every single thing I'm fed.
Middle fingers up, if you don't give a fuck!
You think you're changing anything?
Quick! Change everything!
The world is a shit tip, your children are fucked
The ones you think guard you, are out for your blood
When minds are battered and washed out with style
But what exactly do you think you're gonna do?

United, we'll fail
Divided, we'll fall
We're fucked, but you're makin' it worse
United, we'll fail
Divided, we'll fall
Give up, 'cause you're makin' it so much worse

Middle fingers up, if you don't give a fuck!
I'm sick to death of swallowing every single thing I'm fed
Middle fingers up, if you don't give a fuck!
You think you're changing anything?
Quick! Change everything!

Oh, give me a break you deluded, ireful, self-serving prick
If you really believe in the words that you preach,
Get off your screens, and onto the streets

There will be no peaceful revolution!
No war without blood!
You can say I'm just a fool, that stands for nothing
Well, to that,
I say you're a cunt!

(Kick it!)

United, we'll fail
Divided, we'll fall
United, we'll fail
We're fucked, but you're makin' it worse!

Middle fingers up, if you don't give a fuck!
I'm sick to death of swallowing every single thing I'm fed.
Middle fingers up, if you don't give a fuck!
You think you're changing anything?
Quick! Change everything!

10. Crooked Young

Believe in no one!

Hallelujah!
Well, I'm saved!
Just a dozen steps and 28 days...
It's a miracle, I'll be born again!
With the Lord as my shepherd...
I will find a way!

FUCK YOUR FAITH!
No one's gonna save you!

FUCK YOUR FAITH!

There's no hope for us
We speak in tongues
Blacker than the sun
No, death can't touch...
The crooked young

There's no hope for us
We speak in tongues
Blacker than the sun
No, death can't touch...
The crooked young

The crooked young!

We don't sleep, we don't eat
We speak in tongues
We can't die, we're dead inside
No, death can't touch...
The crooked young

Believe in no one
Find yourself
The faceless won't save you
The clouds won't hear your fucking prayers

(There's no hope for us)
(We speak in tongues)
(Blacker than the sun)
(No, death can't touch...)
(The crooked young)

Hallelujah!
I'm saved!
It's a miracle... thank you Jesus!
Halleluja!
I'm saved!

FUCK YOUR FAITH!
FUCK YOUR FAITH!


11. Hospital For Souls

And then I found out how hard
It is to really change, even hell
Can get comfy once you've settled in.
I just wanted the numb inside me to leave.
No matter how fucked you get,
The sun will return and you come back down!
The funny thing is all I ever wanted i already had..
There's glimpses of heaven in every day!!
In the friends that I have, the music I made,
The love that I feel, I just had to start again..

The days are a death wish
A witch hunt for an exit
I am powerless...

The fragile, the broken
Sit in circles and stay unspoken
We are powerless...

Because we all walk alone on an empty staircase
Idle in the halls and nameless faces
I am powerless...

Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die
I can fear death no longer
I've died a thousand times

A wasteful universe
And we don't know our soul was
Emptiness inside our heads
But no one dares to dwell...

Throw me to the flames
Watch me burn!
Set my world ablaze
Watch me burn!

How are we on a scale of one to ten?
You can tell me, what do you say?
Do you wanna talk about it?
How does that make you feel?

Have you ever took a blade to your wrists
Have you've been skipping meals
We're gonna try something new today
How does that make you feel?

Hold me close, don't let go
Watch me
Hold me close, don't let go
Watch me
Hold me close, don't let go
Watch me
In this hospital for souls

Hold me close, don't let go
Watch me
Hold me close, don't let go
Watch me
Hold me close, don't let go
Watch me
In this hospital for souls

Hold me close, don't let go
Watch me
Hold me close, don't let go
Watch me
Hold me close, don't let go
Watch me
In this hospital for souls

Hold me close, don't let go
Watch me burn...
Hold me close, tell me "go"
Watch me burn...
Hold me close, don't let go
Watch me burn...
In this hospital for souls

Hold me close, don't let go
Watch me burn...
Hold me close, tell me "go"
Watch me burn...
Hold me close, don't let go
Watch me burn...
In this hospital for souls


12. Join The Club

[Deluxe Edition Bonus Disc (The Deathbeds EP) Track]

I know I bend and I break all my promises
But now it's time for the truth
I keep my head in the clouds and I hope that I can't just be invisible to you.

Are you sick, are you tired, are you feeling faint?
Your lips are turning blue
I know you wish you were dead to the world
But there's something you should know

You're scared, I can see you tremble
Shaking like a dog, shitting razor blades
Feel love shadows like a stranger
Well join the club, yeah join the club

Do you wish that you could cut yourself out of your skin?
Well join the club, yeah join the club
Whatever the fuck it takes to feel like you fit in
Well join the club, yeah join the club

Life is a song with no one to dance to
Same old shit happening and nobody knows
My heart is a dead horse, there's no point in beating
Just let me sink, let me sink into the fucking ground

Fuck it

You're scared, I can see you tremble
Shaking like a dog, shitting razor blades
Feel love shadows like a stranger
Well join the club, yeah join the club

Do you think you're the only one who feels the way you do?
We're all fifty shades of fucked up
Well join the club, yeah join the club

13. Chasing Rainbows

[Deluxe Edition Bonus Disc (The Deathbeds EP) Track]

They drag me underground
The lights are slowly fading
The world I thought I knew
I never knew at all

The dead don't make a sound
Unless you're chasing rainbows
And then they scream your name
Clawing at the gates

So pull me out
And hold me down
Let's find a way
To lose ourselves

Take me to the sun
I feel I'm chasing rainbows
And now I'm lost and all alone
Waiting for a chance to

Sink my teeth into
Another desperation
Now into your lonely
Paradise

Are we just dreaming
In the city that never sleeps?
'Cause I can't be seeing
What my eyes tell me

Am I just dreaming?
This can't be in my veins
Everything I ever knew
Will never be the same

(So chew me up, and spit me out
Let's take a way to save ourselves)

So pull me out
And hold me down
Let's find a way
To lose ourselves

Take me to the sun
I feel I'm chasing rainbows
And now I'm lost and all alone
Waiting for a chance to

Sink my teeth into
Another desperation
Now into your lonely
Paradise

And now i feel it
Yeah, i feel it in my blood

I can't fight this anymore
I've given up
I've given up

Take me to the sun
I feel I'm chasing rainbows
And now I'm lost and all alone
Waiting for a chance to

Sink my teeth into
Another desperation
Now into your lonely
Paradise

Take me to the sun
I feel I'm chasing rainbows
And now I'm lost and all alone
Waiting for a chance to

Sink my teeth into
Another desperation
Now into your lonely
Paradise

YEAAAAAAAH!!

14. Deathbeds

[Deluxe Edition Bonus Disc (The Deathbeds EP) Track]

Eyes like a car crash
I know I shouldn't look but I can't turn away.
Body like a whiplash,
Salt my wounds but I can't heal the way
I feel about you.

I watch you like a hawk
I watch you like I'm gonna tear you limb from limb
Will the hunger ever stop?
Can we simply starve this sin?

That little kiss you stole
It held my heart and soul
And like a deer in the headlights I meet my fate
Don't try to fight the storm
You'll tumble overboard
Tides will bring me back to you

And on my deathbed, all I'll see is you
The life may leave my lungs
But my heart will stay with you

That little kiss you stole
It held my heart and soul
And like a ghost in the silence I disappear
Don't try to fight the storm
You'll tumble overboard
Tides will bring me back to you

The waves will pull us under
Tides will bring me back to you
The waves will pull us under
Tides will bring me back to you
The waves will pull us under
Tides will bring me back to you
Tides will bring me back to you

That little kiss you stole
It held my heart and soul
And like a ghost in the silence I disappear
Don't try to fight the storm
You'll tumble overboard
Tides will bring me back to you

That little kiss you stole
It held my heart and soul
And like a deer in the headlights I meet my fate
Don't try to fight the storm
You'll tumble overboard
Tides will bring me back to you

1. i apologise if you feel something

I saw you staring out of your own abyss again
Waiting for something you're not sure even still exists
Don't be afraid to wonder, don't be afraid to be scared
It should never be a prison
So I apologise if you feel something
But love is all we have, feel something, I know
Or if I steal something, please remember it is mine
Real something


2. MANTRA

Do you wanna start a cult with me?
I'm not vibrating like I ought to be
I need a purpose, I can't keep surfing
Through this existential misery
Now we're gonna need some real estate
But if I choose my words carefully
Think I could fool you that I'm the guru
Wait, how do you spell epiphany?

Before the truth will set you free, it will piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra

Could I have your attention, please?
It's time to tap into your tragedy
Think you could use a new abuser
Close your eyes and listen carefully
Imagine you're stood on a beach
Water gently lapping at your feet
And now you're sinking, what were you thinking?
That's all the time we have this week

Before the truth will set you free, it will piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra

And I know this doesn't make a lot of sense
But do you really wanna think all by yourself now?
All I'm asking for's a little bit of faith
You know it's easy to believe
And I know this doesn't make a lot of sense
You know you gotta work the corners of your mind now
All I'm asking for's a little bit of faith
You know it's easy to, so easy to believe

Before the truth will set you free, it will piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Before the truth will set you free, it will piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'Cause all you ever do, is chant the same old mantra


3. nihilist blues

[feat. Grimes]

I've been climbing up the walls
To escape the sinking feeling
But I can't hide from the nihilist at my door
Buried in the basement floor
Didn't know what I had planted
It blossomed with all the heart of a cold war

I'm a spirit in a tomb
Won't somebody raise the roof
I'm going white, I'm going black, I'm going blue
Do you mind if I'm exhumed?
I'm the ashes in the plume
I'm a beggar in the ruin
I'm peaking out, I'm burning up, I'm shooting through
I'm only lonely for the true

Paradise is in my soul
And I'm terrified I can't get out
I'm lost in a labyrinth
We are lost in a labyrinth

Paradise is in my soul
And I'm terrified I can't get out
I'm lost in a labyrinth
We are lost in a labyrinth
Please don't follow

Paradise is in my soul
And I'm terrified I can't get out
I'm lost in a labyrinth
We are lost in a labyrinth
Please don't follow

Light as a feather, stiff as a board
Sink to the floor, I sink to the floor
I sink to the floor
Light as a feather, stiff as a board

You were in my dream last night
But your face was someone else's
A twitch in my spine, a mutual disorder
Isolation neophyte
Too afraid to taste your conscience
You march in the dark, little lamb to the slaughter

I'm a spirit in a tomb
Won't somebody raise the roof
I'm going white, I'm going black, I'm going blue
Do you mind if I'm exhumed?
I'm the ashes in the plume
I'm a beggar in the ruin
I'm peaking out, I'm burning up, I'm shooting through
I'm only lonely for the true

Paradise is in my soul
And I'm terrified I can't get out
I'm lost in a labyrinth
We are lost in a labyrinth
Please don't follow

Paradise is in my soul
And I'm terrified I can't get out
I'm lost in a labyrinth
We are lost in a labyrinth
Please don't follow
Please don't follow
Please don't follow
Please don't follow
Please don't follow

(Please don't follow)

I've been climbing up the walls
To escape the sinking feeling
But I can't hide from the nihilist at my door


4. in the dark

(In the dark)
(In the dark)

Oh, I've done it again
Dug a little deep and it's all caved in
Now I free fall in a black hole
I know I'm getting warm 'cause I feel so cold

But I'm looking on the bright side now
Tryna figure out somehow
(None of this is real, no)
It's looking like I write off now
I think we need to talk like now

So, don't swear to God he never asked you
It's not his heart you drove a knife through
It's not his world you turned inside out
Now his tears still rolling down
Jesus Christ, you're so damn cold
Don't you know you've lost control?
Forget about the things you think I know
No secrets, you can't keep me
(In the dark)
(In the dark)

Deathblow, look at you go
Brought a T-62 to a Rodeo
So tall it broke the fourth wall
Guess my fairytale has a few plot holes

Well, I'm looking on the bright side now
Tryna figure out somehow
(None of this is real, no)
You can give the act up now
Yeah, go ahead and take a bow

So, don't swear to God he never asked you
It's not his heart you drove a knife through
It's not his world you turned inside out
Now his tears still rolling down
Jesus Christ, you're so damn cold
Don't you know you've lost control?
Forget about the things you think I know
No secrets, you can't keep me
(In the dark)
(In the dark)
No secrets, you can't keep me
(In the dark)
(In the dark)

I'm not looking for salvation
Just a little faith in anyone or anything
I'm not looking for salvation
Just a little faith in anyone or anything
I'm not looking for salvation
Just a little faith in anyone or anything
('Cause it's all come caving in)
I'm not looking for salvation
Just a little faith in anyone or anything
(And it's time I knew you, so)

Don't swear to God he never asked you
It's not his heart you drove a knife through
It's not his world you turned inside out
Now his tears still rolling down
Jesus Christ, you're so damn cold
Don't you know you've lost control?
Forget about the things you think I know
No secrets, you can't keep me
(In the dark)

Don't swear to God he never asked you
It's not his heart you drove a knife through
(In the dark)
It's not his world you turned inside out
Now his tears still rolling down
Jesus Christ, you're so damn cold
Don't you know you've lost control?
Forget about the things you think I know
No secrets, you can't keep me
(In the dark)

Don't swear to God he never asked you (Oh no)
It's not his heart you drove a knife through (Oh no)
It's not his world you turned inside out (Oh no)
Now his tears still rolling down (You're so damn cold)
Jesus Christ, you're so damn cold (You're so damn cold)
Don't you know you've lost control? (Oh)
Forget about the things you think I know (Oh)
No secrets, you can't keep me
(In the dark)
(In the dark)
No secrets, you can't keep me
(In the dark)
(In the dark)
(In the dark)


5. wonderful life

[feat. Dani Filth]

Hey there, are we rolling?
Oh, okay; nice, no that's not

I read a fun fact about the brain
And how it starts to deteriorate when
We get to 27 or there abouts (Yeah)
It got me thinking about my head
And what I can do to help stimulate it
Makes me sad, but...
I've forgotten what I'm on about
Woah!

Looked on the bright side, got keratitis
And you can't sit there unless you're righteous
I wear a happy face like I'm Ed Gein
I feel all numb now, is that a feeling?
Like a plastic boxed orange with no peel on
I wanna waste, I wanna waste
I wanna waste away
Yeah!

Alone getting high on a Saturday night
I'm on the edge of a knife
Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life

Oi, Debbie Downer, what's your problem?
Don't wanna be here, still call a shotgun
You got the FOMO coursing through my veins (Yo, yo, yo)
This is not a drill, no, this is the real world
Domnesticated still a little feral
Well, don't you know to chew with your mouth closed?
(And it's all gone wrong!)

Alone getting high on a Saturday night
I'm on the edge of a knife (Yeah)
Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life

(Oh, what a wonderful life)
(Oh, what a wonderful life)
Alright

I got a Type 2 kinda thirstiness
A far out other worldliness
And one day this might hurt me less
But everybody knows I'm still down
Don't tell me what the butcher does
There's no need for the obvious
So ugly still it's kinda lush
But everybody knows I made vows
Left feet on the podium
Can't think of an alternate
And hell yeah, I'm the awkwardest
But everybody know I got bounce

Alone getting high on a Saturday night
I'm on the edge of a knife
Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life
Oh, what a wonderful life
Oh, what a wonderful life
Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life
Oh, what a wonderful life
Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive
Oh, what a wonderful life


6. ouch

Tu as tué mon bébé
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na

I always knew this is gonna end in tears
Didn't think your wrists would keep a souvenir
And I thought that I had heard it all
Till I heard your lover screaming down the phone
I know I said I was under your spell
But this hex is on another level
And I know I said you could drag me through Hell
But I hoped you wouldn’t fuck the Devil

Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na

This was gonna end in tears
Didn't think your wrists would keep a souvenir
And I thought that I had it all
Till I heard your lover screaming down the phone
I know I said I was under your spell
But this hex is on another level
And I know I said you could drag me through Hell
But I hoped you wouldn't fuck the Devil


7. medicine

Some people are a lot like clouds, you know
(Clouds, you know; clouds, you know)
'Cause life's so much brighter when they go
You rained on my heart for far too long (Far too long)
Couldn't see the thunder for the storm
Because I cut my teeth and bit my tongue
Till my mouth was dripping blood
But I never dished the dirt, just held my breath
While you dragged me through the mud
I don't know why I tried to save you 'cause
I can't save you from yourself
When all you give a shit about is everybody else

And you just can't quit, why don't you deal with it?
I think it's time to stop

You need a taste of your own medicine
'Cause I'm sick to death of swallowing
Watch me take the wheel like you, not feel like you
Act like nothing's real like you
So, I'm sorry for this
It might sting a bit

Some people are a lot like clouds, you know
(Clouds, you know; clouds, you know)
'Cause life's so much brighter when they go
And I spent too long in a place I don't belong
I couldn't see the thunder for the storm

But you won't admit, why don't you get a grip?
'Cause you can't keep going on and on and on and on like this
And you just can't quit, why don't you deal with it?
I think it's time to stop

You need a taste of your own medicine
'Cause I'm sick to death of swallowing
Watch me take the wheel like you, not feel like you
Act like nothing's real like you
So, I'm sorry for this
It might sting a bit

'Cause I cut my teeth and bit my tongue
Till my mouth was dripping blood
But I never dished the dirt, just held my breath
While you dragged me through the mud
Yeah, I cut my teeth and bit my tongue
Till my mouth was dripping blood
But I never dished the dirt, just held my breath
While you dragged me through the mud

And you just can't quit, why don't you deal with it?
I think it's time to stop

You need a taste of your own medicine
'Cause I'm sick to death of swallowing
Watch me take the wheel like you, not feel like you
Act like nothing's real like you
So, I'm sorry for this
It might sting a bit
Taste of your own medicine (Taste of your own medicine)
Yeah, I'm sick to death of swallowing (Sick to death, wow)
Watch me take the wheel like you, not feel like you
Act like nothing's real like you
So, I'm sorry for this
It might sting a bit

Some people are a lot like clouds, you know
(Clouds, you know; clouds, you know)
'Cause life's so much brighter when they go


8. sugar honey ice & tea

Count down the thunder
I think we're too close for comfort
So no, don't rock the boat and don't calm the storm
God already gave you His answer

Blink, I'm sorry, it's over
The whistle's been blown, I
Think you got the wrong number
I'm breaking up
Wanna make a connection
Can't get no reception
Leave a message after the tone

'Cause it's got my head running 24/7
I don't know if I can figure it out
It's all messed up, only one thing I know for sure
We're so full of

Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
(Everybody's full of)
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea

Don't move a muscle
No, we can't have a struggle
But the "situation is in control"
So play pretend that it's all good
You could tell the Messiah
His pants are on fire
I politely decline, I
I gotta go, I gotta stick my head in the sand
And block out all the sadness
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

'Cause it's got my head running 24/7
I don't know if I can figure it out
It's all messed up, only one thing I know for sure
We're so full of

Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
(Yeah, everybody's full of)
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea

And it's got my head running 24/7
I don't reckon I can figure it out
It's all messed up, only one thing I know for sure
(We're so fucked)
And we all march on like we know the way to Heaven
Who the hell died and made you the king?
We don't know what we want, but we know that we want it
Yeah, we want it, yeah, we want it right now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
(Fuck you) Everybody, everybody's full of

Sugar, honey, ice, and tea (Oh, and now everybody's full of)
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea (Every, every, everybody full of)
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea (Oh, everybody's full of)
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)


9. why you gotta kick me when i'm down?

I see you

You on the edge of your seat
Ain't you got some place to be?
Was hoping the suspense would kill you
Tell me, how would you begin?
Watching and waiting to sink your teeth in
Come on and give me your expert opinion
Ah, fuck it

I settle down in a dump
Heard a crowd screaming "Jump"
So I came to the window
(They always wanna kick you when you're down)
I said, "What the fuck have I done?"
They said, "We just want your blood,
You know we like you better in limbo"
(They always wanna kick you when you're down)

So come on and take a shot, you just can't get enough
Don't let the fact that you know nothing stop you talking now
'Cause when all is said and done, my name's still on your tongue

But tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?
You better pray I don't get up this time around
And why you tryna put me in the ground?
Don't you know I'm a seed?
I won't stop at the roof
Go ahead, bury me
This is how I grow, it's how I thrive
So why you gotta kick me when I'm down?
(Why you gotta kick me when I'm down?)

Yeah, I know it's all in good fun, but
Don't say it's coming from love now
I see those arms in akimbo
(They always wanna kick you when you're down)
And don't set that phaser to stun
'Cause what doesn't kill me, well, it better run like hell
Yeah, you better run like hell

So come on and take a shot, you just can't get enough
Don't let the fact that you know nothing stop you talking now
'Cause when all is said and done, my name's still on your tongue

But tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?
You better pray I don't get up this time around
And why you tryna put me in the ground?
Don't you know I'm a seed?
I won't stop at the roof
Go ahead, bury me
This is how I grow, it's how I thrive

Remember this line that you crossed?
Look back and stare at the dot
Know there's no turning back now
Now that you've opened the gates
Corrupted the memory, error, failsafe
(Commence the countdown)
(They always wanna kick you when you're down)
Remember this line that you crossed?
Look back and stare at the dot
Know there's no way to fix us, no
Oh, God, what the fuck have you done?
I loved you like daughters, I loved you like sons

So tell me, yeah tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?
You better pray I don't get up this time around
And why you tryna to put me in the ground?
Don't you know I'm a seed?
I won't stop at the roof
Go ahead, bury me
This is how I grow, this is how I thrive
Why you gotta kick me when I'm down?

Tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?
(This is how I grow, this is how I thrive)

11. mother tongue

I didn't see it coming
But I never really had much faith
In the universe's magic, oh no
Till it pulled us to that time and place
And I'll never forget
When the floodgates opened, we, we cried an ocean
It still has me choking, it's hard to explain
I know you know me, you don't have to show me
I, I feel you're lonely, no need to explain

So don't say you love me, fala "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words can ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue
So don't say you love me, fala "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words can ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue

And yeah, I could be punching
But I always tend to fluctuate
And I feel sick that I'm buzzing, oh love, I'm in trouble
I'm sorry, but you got me gushing all over the place
And I don't wanna get wet
But I think we're chosen like our fates were woven
And all of those bad choices were left turns on the way

So don't say you love me, fala "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words can ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue
So don't say you love me, fala "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words can ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue

I think the best way to explain it's like (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Kinda like that, but more (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Yeah, that makes sense, right, like (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Like (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Like (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

So don't say you love me, fala "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words can ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue
So don't say you love me, fala "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words can ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue
So don't say you love me, fala "amo"
Just let your heart speak up, and I'll know
No amount of words can ever find a way to make sense of this
So I wanna hear your mother tongue


12. heavy metal

[feat. Rahzel]

I woke up in a warehouse
But the label had fell off
Just minding my own meltdown
It was then I heard the cannibals, cannibals

They said, hey kid
You got that something special
(It's now or never)
You wanna live forever
(It's now or never)
You know what we want, you should give it to us
(It's now or never)
(But there's no pressure)

And I keep picking petals
I'm afraid you don't love me anymore
'Cause a kid on the 'gram in a Black Dahlia tank
Says it ain't heavy metal
(And that's alright)
(That's alright)

I tried to do a headcount
But I cut off all the crusts
Said they liked it better curly
Then they gut me like an animal, animal

They said, hey man
You had that something special
(It's now or never)
Let's keep it quintessential
(It's now or never)
You know what we want, why not give it to us?
(It's now or never)
(But there's no pressure)

So I keep picking petals
I'm afraid you don't love me anymore
'Cause a kid on the 'gram in a Black Dahlia tank
Says it ain't heavy metal
Yeah I keep picking petals
Got my heart and my head all in the wars
'Cause some kid from A&R in a Patagonia
Says he don't really get it, no

So I keep picking petals
All I wanna know do you love me anymore
'Cause some kid on the 'gram said he used to be a fan
But this shit ain't heavy metal

(And that's alright)

And I keep picking petals
I'm afraid you don't love me anymore
'Cause a kid on the 'gram in a Black Dahlia tank
Says it ain't heavy metal
And I keep picking petals
I'm afraid you don't love me anymore
'Cause a kid on the 'gram said he used to be a fan
But this shit ain't heavy metal

No, this ain't heavy metal
No, this ain't heavy metal


13. i don't know what to say

I'll see you at the gates when it gets dark
You jump the wall, I'll find a place to park
Kill the angels if they're keeping guard
How do I start when you don't know what to say?
No, I don't know what to say

You said the world's already full enough
Of defeated people and you would not be one
Always a choice to move yourself along
And find better and I hope that's where you are
Yeah, I know that's where you are

A doppelgänger with a telling scar
I saw the universe hidden in your heart
Wish I told you this before it got too dark
Where do you start when you know it has to end?

How a flower in the rain
Only grows more when it's grey
You just shined on brighter
Making gold out of the pain
"I can die, but I can't break," you said
"You can rule, I won't obey"
As long as I'm still smiling
Well, I don't know what to say

1. Crucify Me

[feat. Lights]

Crucify me, nail my hands to a wooden cross
There is nothing above, there is nothing below
Heaven and hell live in all of us
And I've been cast astray

I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
Lost in the abyss, drowned in the deep
No set of lungs could salvage me

Only a shipwreck, only a ghost
Merely a graveyard of your former self
We just watched the waves crash over
I've been cast astray

There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret
No one needs to know
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret
No one needs to know

I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
Lost in the abyss, drowned in the deep
No set of lungs could salvage me
Save yourself, save your breath
The tides too strong, you'll catch your death
So breathe for me, just breathe

There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret

If we make it through the night, if we make it out alive
We'll have mercy and pray for the dead
Are you saying that you can save me
Don't hope to ever find me
And I fear I'm too far gone
Pray for the dead

If we make it through the night, if we make it out alive
We'll have mercy and pray for the dead
Are you saying that you can save me
Don't hope to ever find me
And I fear I'm too far gone
Pray for the dead

Pray for the dead [x3]

Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your full undivided attention?
There is something you all really need to know

There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret

If we make it through the night, if we make it out alive
You say that you can save me
Don't hope to ever find me
And I'll say that you forgot.
Pray for the dead.

If we make it through the night, if we make it out alive
We'll have mercy and pray for the dead
You say that you can save me
Don't hope to ever find me
And I'll say that you forgot.
Pray for the dead.

I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me

I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me


2. Anthem

This is an anthem, so fucking sing
A dedication to the end of everything
This is an anthem, so fucking sing (so fucking sing)
A dedication to the end of everything

Someone call an ambulance, I got wounds to attend
Someone call a doctor, I fear this is the end
This happens all the time
This happens every day
But I never seem to quit
The wolves never stay at bay

I hate to say, "I told you so"
But fuck it, I told you so
And don't say a word, I already know

This is an anthem, so fucking sing
A dedication to the end of everything
This is an anthem, so fucking sing (so fucking sing)
A dedication to the end of everything

Someone call an exorcist, and help me kill this curse
I can't stop the bleeding, and it's only getting worse
This happens all the time
This happens every day
But I never seem to quit
The wolves never stay at bay

No, they don't stay!

I hate to say, "I told you so"
But fuck it, I told you so
And don't say a word, I already know
I already know

This is an anthem, so fucking sing (so fucking sing)
A dedication to the end of everything

Yeah
Get the fuck up
This is it, the sound of giving in
Yeah
Get the fuck up
This is it, the end of everything

Tastes so bitter, feels so sweet
Lost in a dream, never fell asleep
Tastes so bitter, feels so sweet
I've come back to old remedies

This is an anthem, so fucking sing
This is an anthem, so fucking sing

This is an anthem, so fucking sing
A dedication to the end of everything
This is an anthem, so fucking sing (so fucking sing)
A dedication to the end of everything
To the end of everything

This is an anthem, so fucking sing
A dedication to the end of everything

[Guy:] Do you feel better now?...
[Girl:] Yes
[Guy:] Less nervous...
[Girl:] Much less
[Guy:] Do you have any special feelings?
[Girl:] I feel as if my heart has been touched by Christ


3. It Never Ends

Started off as a one night stand. Lingered to a fling.
The sirens and the sergeants didn't seem to mean a thing.
Hide your fangs all you want, you still need the blood.
Tell us that it's different now, you're up to no good.

Take my hand, show me the way, we are the children that fell from grace.
Take my hand, show me the way, we are the children who can't be saved.

One more nail in the coffin. One more foot in the grave.
One more time I'm on my knees as I try to walk away.

How has it come to this?

I've said it once. I've said it twice. I've said it a thousand fucking times.
That I'm OK, that I'm fine. That it's all just in my mind.
But this has got the best of me. And I can't seem to sleep.
It's not 'cause you're not with me. It's 'cause you never leave.

You say this is suicide? I say this is a war.
And I'm losing the battle. Man down!

Is this what you call love? This is a war I can't (win).

One more nail in the coffin. One more foot in the grave.
One more time I'm on my knees, as I try to walk away

Everything I loved became everything I lost.

I've said it once. I've said it twice. I've said it a thousand fucking times.
That I'm OK, that I'm fine. That it's all just in my mind.
But this has got the best of me. And I can't seem to sleep.
And it's not 'cause you're not with me. It's 'cause you never leave.
And it's not 'cause you're not with me. It's 'cause you never leave.

[4x]
Every second. Every minute. Every hour. Every day.
It never ends!
It never ends!


4. Fuck

[featuring Josh Franceschi of You Me At Six]

Let's fuck, 'til the sun comes up
'Cause we haven't got long, but we got enough.
A night to remember, a day to forget,
Don't stop til we pirouette.
I'm no saint, you're no martyr.
One more time we are together,
How do you say "goodbye"?

How do you say "goodbye",
When you've hardly said "hello"?
The only way we know,
The only way we know,
The only way we know,
The only way we know.
How do you say "goodbye",
When you've hardly said "hello"?

Let's fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
Let's fuck, 'til our lungs give out,
It won't be long.
A night to remember, a day to forget.
If our eyes were diamonds, we'd be rich.
Your voice makes my heart skip beats,
So keep quiet before it quits on me.
Your voice makes my heart skip beats,
So keep quiet before it flat lines.
Before it flat lines!

I'm dead, tell them all we're dead.
We can hold the wake right here in this bed.
Sunk into you, tangled in sheets.
Buried in blankets six foot deep again.
Kick it!

Fuck, fuck, fuck

Let's fuck, 'til the sun comes up
'Cause we haven't got long, but we got enough.
A night to remember, a day to forget.
(Don't stop 'til we pirouette!)
I'm no saint, you're no martyr.
One more time we are together,
How do you say "goodbye"?

How do you say "goodbye",
When you've hardly said "hello"?
How do you say "goodbye",
When you've hardly said "hello"?

We're young and in love,
Heart attacks waiting to happen,
So come a little closer, tell me it's all in our heads.
We're young and in love,
Heart attacks waiting to happen,
So come a little closer, tell me those three little words.

We're young and in love,
Heart attacks waiting to happen,
So come a little closer, tell me it's all in our heads.
We're young and in love,
Heart attacks waiting to happen,
So come a little closer, tell me those three little words.

We're young and in love,
Heart attacks waiting to happen,
So come a little closer, tell me it's all in our heads.
We're young and in love,
Heart attacks waiting to happen,
So come a little closer, tell me those three little words.


5. Don't Go

[featuring Lights]

I was raised in the valley, there was shadows and death.
Got out alive but with scars I can't forget.
This kid back in school, subdued and shy.
An orphan and a brother and unseen by most eyes.
I don't know what it was that made a piece of him die,
Took a boy to the forest, slaughtered him with a scythe.
Stamped on his face, an impression in the dirt.
Do you think the silence makes a good man convert?

We all have our horrors and our demons to fight.
But how can I win, when I'm paralyzed?
They crawl up on my back, wrap their fingers round my throat.
Is this what I get for the choices that I made?
God forgive me, for all my sins. God forgive me, for everything.
God forgive me, for all my sins. God forgive me, God forgive me.

Don't go, I can't do this on my own.
Don't go, I can't do this on my own.
Save me from the ones that haunt me in the night.
I can't live with myself, so stay with me tonight.
Don't go.
Don't go.

[Lights:]
If I let you in, you'd just want out.
If I tell you the truth, you'd vie for a lie.
If I spilled my guts, it would make a mess we can't clean up.
If you follow me, you will only get lost.
If you try to get closer, we'll only lose touch.
Yes you already know too much, and you're not going anywhere.

Tell me that you need me 'cause I love you so much.
Tell me that you love me 'cause I need you so much.
Tell me that you need me 'cause I love you so much.
Say you'll never leave me 'cause I need you so much.

Don't go, I can't do this on my own.
Don't go, I can't do this on my own.
Save me from the ones that haunt me in the night.
I can't live with myself, so stay with me tonight.
Don't go, I can't do this on my own.
Don't go.
Save me from the ones that haunt me in the night.
I can't live with myself, so stay with me tonight.
Don't go.

[Lights:]
Don't go. [x11]


6. Home Sweet Hole

Cross my heart, I don't want to die.
But heaven knows it seems like I try.
Lost in a labyrinth for weeks on end.
I live and I learn from my mistakes, then I forget them again.

Got a feeling in my stomach that just won't quit.
It's subtle as a shotgun.
Heavy as a brick.
Because I'm staring at the devil and the truth of it is, he's a lot more familiar than I'd care to admit.

If only I could focus, maybe if I could see.
If I didn't know any better, I would say he looks just like me.
The roof is crashing down, the walls are caving in.
We discover all your stories are just works of fiction.
The roof is crashing down.
The truth is spilling out.

[2x]
Oh shit, I've done it again.
I'm in way too far in over my head.
Crossed the line, so many times, that I don't even know what it stands for.

[2x]
Home sweet hole, just be careful what you wish for.
Home sweet hole, just be careful what you say.

Got a feeling in my stomach that just won't quit.
It's subtle as a shotgun.
Heavy as a brick.
Bite your tongue.
Just bite your tongue.
You've already said quite enough.

[Speaking]
The roof is crashing down, the walls are caving in.
We discover all your stories are just works of fiction.
The roof is crashing down.
The truth is spilling out.
[2x]

[2x]
Oh shit, I've done it again.
I'm in way too far in over my head.
Crossed the line, so many times, that I don't even know what it stands for.

[4x]
You wear your lies like a noose around your neck.
So kick the chair and let's be done with it.

[2x]
Home sweet hole, just be careful what you wish for.
Home sweet hole, just be careful what you say.


7. Alligator Blood

[x2]
Let's play a game of Russian roulette,
I'll load the gun, you place the bets.
Tell me, who will make it out alive.

Over and over and over again, we play the same old game.
Cards kept close to our chest, that's where your secrets kept.
So wear your poker face, hands to the fool, hands to the thief, and you can't see.

[x2]
My alligator blood is starting to show,
I know that you know that, I know that you know.
Can't call a bluff with a dead mans hand.

Cut me up and wear my skin,
show me how to live.
Tear me down, clean me up,
just fill my fucking cup.
Just help me find a way.
Just help me find a way.
Just help me find a way.
Just help me find a way.

[x2]
My alligator blood is starting to show,
I know that you know that, I know that you know.
Can't call a bluff with a dead mans hand.

[x2]
Put a gun to my head and, paint the walls with my brains.
Put a gun to my head and, paint the walls.

Now you know. [x3]

[x2]
Now you know you can go, you can give up trying.
Should of just called it quits,
should of just called it quits,
leave before it's too late.

[x2]
Let's play a game of Russian roulette,
I'll load the gun, you place the bet.
Tell me who will make it out alive.

Yeah!

(So put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my fucking brain.)

Put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brains.
Put a gun to my head and paint the fucking walls.


8. Visions

This is a call to arms, so grab your guns and get your horses.
Only the dead have seen the end of this fight.
This is a call to arms, so all you fallen soldiers sing with me: death or glory.

So march with me if you believe there's any hope for us.
I've been hiding in these trenches for far too long.
All is fair in love and war, so they tell me.
All is fair in love and war, so they say.

Come on, come on, there has to be a better way.
Get up, get up, let's leave this mess.
I know a place that we can get away from all of this.
Come on come on, get up get up.

I've been dreaming of us leaving everything and everyone we've ever known.
I've been thinking all these visions must be a sign, so hold on and don't let go.
No, we can't leave till you tell me everything.
So come clean, don't talk in tongues. Talk in tongues.
It's time to bring out your dead.
And the skeletons that you've been hiding.
Tell me everything I need to know.
Bring out your dead. [2x]

So march with me if you believe there's any hope for us.
I've been hiding in these trenches for far too long.
All is fair in love and war, so they tell me.
All is fair in love and war, so they say.

Come on come on, get up get up.
I know a place that we can get away from all of this.
Yeah.

[2x]
I couldn't see a thing till I shut my eyes.
I never knew a thing till I lost my mind.
I would sell my soul to know it all, but I held the keys all this time.

[2x]
I've been dreaming of us leaving everything and everyone we've ever known.
I've been thinking all these visions must be a sign, so hold on and don't let go.

Bring out your dead. [3x]


9. Blacklist

So just like that you're fucking dead and gone
You can only wear a crown of thorns for so long
We built an empire and you took the throne
But you built it from bayonets and sat there alone
I hope your queen was worth it,
Do you still serve her on your knees?
Because you sat when the world was at your feet,
Just slept while we lived the dream

You won't miss the water,
Till the river runs dry
You won't miss the sunset,
Till it burns out the sky
You won't miss what you have,
Till it's finally lost
But you don't miss a bastard,
When you're bearing his fucking cross

Blacklist
Nothing but a blacklist
With friends like you,
There's no need for enemies
With friends like you,
There's no need for anything

Blacklist
You're nothing but a blacklist

Well, truth be told
I'm a little bit gutted
I mean you were always a prick,
But we still seemed to love you
We started this together and it should have stuck
But there's no room for a useless, miserable fuck
Well I know I was a cunt in the final days
It just filled me with venom, filled me with rage
To see someone not give a shit,
Despite of all of this
I won't see you around, I couldn't give a fuck
I'd rather slit my wrists than keep in touch
You're on my blacklist and there's nothing left to say
We're finished breaking our bones, dragging dead fucking weight


10. Memorial

[Instrumental]


11. Blessed With A Curse

Ever since this began, I was blessed with a curse.
And for better or for worse I was born into a hearse.
I know I said my heart beats for you. I was lying girl, it beats for two.
Because I got your love and I got these vices.
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you.
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you.

Ever since this began, I was blessed with a curse.
And for better or for worse I was born into a hearse.
I know I said my heart beats for you. I was lying girl.
I've been lying to you...

Everything I touch turns to stone.
So wrap your arms around me, and leave me on my own.
Everything I touch turns to stone.
So wrap your arms around me, and leave me on my own.

Take back every word I've said, ever said to you. [4x]
Because everything I touch turns to stone.
So wrap your arms around me, and leave me, I can't hold on.l

Take back every word I've said, ever said to you.
Take back every word I've said, every word I've said.
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you. [2x]


12. The Fox And The Wolf

[featuring Josh Scogin of The Chariot]

You said you can't get to heaven unless you get high
But there's no word of hell on the way back down
You said it's now or never,
You only live once

Would you be so quick to walk over to my grave?
You said you'll never be younger than you are tonight
Now I've never felt weaker in all my life
You said it's only a one off, only a line
But now it's a circle, all of the time
Well, it's a one man cult and he's serving his line
It's a "Lust For Life" but it's a lifeless wine
He kissed her hand and then he found out her name,
It's Death and now he can't seem to wake

You can't run with the foxes and yet hunt with the wolf

Are you addicted?
Tell me the truth

I think I'm losing my mind

They say the poison's in the dosage and they must be right
Left with panic attacks and death riding our backs
It all looks so much worse on the way back down
I'm so fucked up since I hit the ground

Revive me

1. The Comedown

Urrgggh!

Here I am, once again. Just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed, so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.

"Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes"
I can't go on like this.
"Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes"
I can't go on like this.

Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it.
And I can't believe that it's getting harder just to feel alive.
It's getting harder just to feel alive.

Curtains close; take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed, so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave, so God help me die in it.

Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it.
And I can't believe that...
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it.
And I can't believe that...

And I dug my grave, so I'll lie in it. (Lie in it, lie in it)
I've made my bed, so I'll die in it. (Die in it)
I dug my grave
I dug my grave

I'd rather live, than live forever!

I'm knocking on Death's door, but you're already dead.
It's either now, or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said.
All I can say...
All I can say for sure is, we're coming out tonight.
All I can say for sure is, we're coming up tonight.

Just like the living dead,
Just like the living dead,
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it.
And I can't believe that...

Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it.
And I can't believe that...
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it.
And I can't believe that it's getting harder just to feel alive.
It's getting harder just to feel alive.


2. Chelsea Smile

I've got a secret.
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you don't know.

It sits in silence, eats away at me.
It feeds like cancer. This guilt could fill a fucking sea.
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door.
Now falling and failing is all I know.

This disease is getting worse.
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse.
The only thing I really know: I can't sleep at night.
I'm buried and breathing in regret.
Yeah!
The only thing I really know: I can't sleep at night.
I'm buried and breathing in regret.

I've got a secret.
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you don't know.

I've got a secret.
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you don't know.

I may look happy, but honestly dear,
the only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear.
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed.
They lick their lips, as all the shame spills out of me.

Repent! Repent! The end is nigh!
Repent! Repent! We're all gonna die!
Repent! Repent! These secrets will kill us!
So get on your knees, and pray for...

Repent! Repent! The end is nigh!
Repent! Repent! We're all gonna die!
Repent! Repent! These secrets will kill us!
So get on your knees, and pray for forgiveness!

We all carry these things inside that no one else can see.
They hold us down like anchors. They drown us out at sea.
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see.
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?

Ruh!

I've got a secret.
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you don't know.

I've got a secret.
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you will never know.
You will never know.
I know something you don't know.


3. It Was Written In Blood

Goodbye my friend, goodbye my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part,
and be united by and by, united by and by.
Goodbye no handshake to endure.
Now there's nothing.

It was written in blood
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
Oh god, written in blood
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
Oh my god, it was written in blood

Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow.
There's nothing new in dying now. [x2]
Though living is no newer... [x2]
And it was written in blood.

It was written in blood
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
Oh my god, it was written in blood
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
Oh my god!
It was written... in blood
On a suicide note

Like roses, we blossom then die [x3]
Like roses, we've fallen apart [x2]
Like roses, we blossom then die [x3]
Like roses, we've fallen apart [x2]

Though living is no newer [x2]

(It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note, the day before he died)

It was written in blood
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
My god, written in blood
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
Oh my god!
It was written... in blood

Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We've fallen apart (Fallen apart!)
We've fallen apart (Fallen apart!)
Fallen apart
We fall, like roses

Like roses [x2]
Roses...[x2
Like roses...[x2]


4. Death Breath

The sun goes down, we come out.
A different party in a different city.
The sun comes up, we come down.
We lived fast & died pretty.

"WE'RE ALL VAMPIRES AND WE OWN THIS FUCKING NIGHT"

I'm not homesick, i am just so sick of going home.
I've been walking these streets for days.
In search of blood.
Yeah I'd kill for the sun to never rise again.
I'd do anything oh anything.

So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight till it breaks.
You cant kill us , we never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only you could see how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out


5. Football Season Is Over

Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi - every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone. I can't see anything!

The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night. I can't remember anything!

"Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead.
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs"
We are done with giving a fuck.


6. Sleep With One Eye Open

Fuck you,
You took what you wanted and left, like locusts.
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You bled me dry and then left, like leeches.
Go, you got what you could now leave, like vultures

Ripped apart in minutes what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back may as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember, you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, you're on your fucking own.
(because)

If I had it my way I'd slit your throat with the knife you left in my back
All the shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you and this is your world
Fucking falling apart mate, from the inside out.
Everything will fall at your feet - you got hell to pay

And you better fucking bow down to me
You better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees and cry me a fucking river

Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever, cunt.


7. Diamonds Aren't Forever

[x6]
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead

I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes!

[Chorus:]
I have loved, and I have lost.
I have turned, and I have tossed.
I have listened, and I have watched.
I've gave into this for long enough!
I have lost, and I have loved.
Sleep has stolen far too much.
Close your eyes, but not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death!

[x2]
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
Figure it out

[Chorus]

So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever?
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever?

I can promise you one thing: Death will take us all!
I can promise you one thing: You will die alone!

We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style!
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie!

We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest

I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes!


8. The Sadness Will Never End

Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight

I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself

Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck

I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure

Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under

I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself

Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch

I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy

I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy


9. No Need For Introductions, I've Read About Girls Like You On The Back Of Toilet Doors

For people like you, there is no such thing as an early grave.
You wanted to gut my dreams until I was empty, and show everyone my remains.

And after everything you put me through, I should of FUCKING PISSED ON YOU!


10. Suicide Season

We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore.
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places.
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too.
For when he died, he took a part of you.

No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes.
No explanations, no fucking reasons why.
I watched it eat you up, pieces falling on the floor.
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore.

If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way.
I would climb my way to heaven, and bring him back home.
Don't give up hope, my friend, this is not the end.

We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore.
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places.
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too.
For when he died, he took a part of you.

Death is only a chapter, so lets rip out the pages of yesterday.
Death is only a horizon. And I'm ready for sun to set.

THIS IS SUICIDE SEASON!

[whispering:]
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way.
we would climb my way to heaven, and bring home again. [x2]

This is Suicide Season. [x2]

If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way.
We would climb my way to heaven, and bring home again. [x2]

If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way.
We would climb my way to heaven, and bring home again. [x3]

We would do anything to get him back to you.
We would do anything to end what your going through.
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way.
I would climb my way to heaven, and bring him back home.
I would do anything to bring him back to you.
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew.

1. Pray For Plagues

FLYYYYYY!

She starts her new diet, of liquor and dick,
Just like Hollywood but laced in sick.
The sun goes down and so does she.
The sun goes down and so does she.
Sold out the love that she had left with a cut of the throat.
Drinks all round on her before she strolls to the moat.
The sun goes down and so does she.
The sun goes down and so does she.

Count your fucking...
Blessings!
Come on!
Count your blessings,
Because I'm counting every lie.
Count your blessings,
Because I'm counting every lie.
Counting every lie.

Christ, I'm asking you for just one thing
I'm asking you for just one thing
Eradicate, this disease.

Close your eyes.
Pray for plagues.
Oh Lord cleanse this earth
And bring upon our doomsday.
Close your eyes.
Pray for plagues.
Cleanse this earth
And bring doomsday.

She starts her new diet, of liquor and dick,
Just like Hollywood but laced in sick.
The sun goes down and so does she.
The sun goes down and so does she.

So clap your hands to the sound
Of everyone first born dying now.
Watch the rivers flow with blood
Having death stand were life once stood

So clap your hands to the sound
Of everyone first born dying now.
Watch the rivers turn to blood
Having death stand were life once stood
[x2]

Close your eyes.
Pray for plagues.
Cleanse this earth
Bring our doomsday.


2. Tell Slater Not To Wash His Dick

I've been away for every day and every fucking night.
I've seen your eyes, I've seen your eyes, I've seen your eyes.
I've been away for every day and every fucking night.
And with every city, it gets harder.

You've got a mouth like a razor-blade. It cuts so deep.
So kiss my wrists, my neck and give me eternal sleep.

You say, you say, I'm only a phone call away.
But for me, this distance is decay.

So line my throat with lipstick and leave my blood for flies.
I'll gurgle the blues under a sea of lies.
Before you take me to sea, let me kiss the bride.
Now take my body to the shore and ill wait for the tide.

I will always love you!
But I need pills to sleep.
I have always failed you!
So throw away my memories.

So throw away my memories.


3. For Stevie Wonders Eyes Only (Braille)

It's 3:18, mouth tastes like the corpse of every pregnant teen,
The minutes are hours, the hours are days,
I feel infected by your presence, you speak in tongues,
I smell the lies dancing on your blackened lungs,

I whispered in her ear:
Fear me dear, for I am Death,
I'll take your hope, your dreams, your love,
Till there's nothing left

I whispered in her ear:
You better fear me dear, for I am Death,
I'll take that shit you call a life, in a single fucking breath.

I'll take your hope,
I'll take your fucking dreams!
I'll take your love,
I'll take everything you fucking...
BITCH!

I'll steal the diamonds
From your eyes,
I'll turn your promises
Into lies,
I'll steal the diamonds
From your eyes,
I'll turn your promises
Into lies.

It's 3:18, mouth tastes like the corpse of every pregnant teen,
The hours are days, the days are dead,
I feel infected by your presence, you speak in tongues,
I smell the lies dancing on your blackened lungs,

I hear the fear in your voice
But you shouldn't feel a thing,
Your life's already worse than any pain that I could bring,
That I could bring,
That I could bring,

I could make it December every day,
But you're so blind, it may as well be May,

And I whispered in her ear:
You better fear me dear, for this is Death
And I whispered in her ear:
Fear me, 'cause I am Death

One more time,

I whispered in her ear:
Fear me dear, for I am Death,
I'll take everything you ever loved

I whispered in her ear:
You better fear me, for I am Death.
For I am Death.
For I am Death

Bitch


4. A Lot Like Vegas

So cash in all your chips tonight baby
Cause were going out of style.
We could leave this city, if only for a while.
Well take this feeling to our graves
For every heart that we betrayed.
No one can know about this.
Well take this feeling to our graves
For every heart that we betrayed.
No one can know about this.

The only place ill ever call home, is my deathbed.

I know we're so wrong
But it feels so right.
And its not a party,
If it happens every night.
I'm running on empty,
Your running out of luck.
So lets ditch this city,
Before we sober up


5. Black & Blue

I guess some kids are just born with tragedy in their blood,
I try to wash this away,
I wanna cleanse your
VEINS!

I can help you see the light
Out of your despair,
You tie the rope,
I'll kick the fucking chair!

I feel the malice in my veins
My heart swells with hatred in your name,
And when you've got nothing to turn black and blue,
You've still got Hell to look forward to,

(You've still got Hell
You've still got Hell
When you've still got Hell)

I will dance on your grave,
I will dance on your fucking grave,
I will dance on your grave,
I will dance on your grave,

Oh, when you're blessed with a grave to call your own,
In my mind you'll be six feet closer to your home,
Your eulogy will be music,
Your eulogy will be music to my ears,

Oh, yeah,

I can help you to see light out of your despair,
You tie the rope, I'll kick the fucking chair,

I feel the malice in my veins,
And my heart swells with hatred in your name,
And when you've got nothing to be black and blue,
You've still got Hell,
You've still got Hell to look forward to,

Black and blue,
Black and blue,

I have never really fucking cared,
She never fucking, had fucking air,
I have never really fucking cared,
Tie the rope, I'll kick the fucking chair,
Let's go


6. Slow Dance

[Instrumental]


7. Liquor & Love Lost

I thought I saw your eyes,
Laced in smoke & cigarette curls.
I thought I saw your eyes
But I'm seeing ghosts tonight.

She haunts me!
'til my bitter end.
She haunts me!

I swear I heard your voice, overwhelmed by conversation.
I swear I heard your voice but I'm hearing ghosts tonight!
The bars turn out there lights.
And I drink away the day as it decays.

So much for living forever,
So much for death do us part

She haunts me!
She haunts me!
She haunts me!
Every fucking...
NIGHT!


8. (I Used To Make Out With) Medusa

Dead hands clutch my arm
The smell of death fills the air
Her fragrance,
Her carcass reanimates.

Oh, if you need me
I'll be tying a rope to the tree
Where our love used to be.

I've took down every photo of us and buried them at sea.
I've took down every photo of us and buried them at sea.
Don't worry dearest
Beauty is only skin deep.

Psyche!

Your beauty is no more.
So why don't you just fuck yourself you fucking whore.
Your beauty is no more.
So why don't you just fuck yourself you stupid fucking whore.

Well I should of known,
Not to look into her eyes
I'm cast to stone,
Her glare was my demise!

Medusa.
Medusa.

Your beauty is no more.
So why don't you just fuck yourself you fucking whore.

Dead hands clutch my arm
The smell of death fills the air
Her fragrance,
Her carcass reanimates.

Since you left me, things have never been the same.

Hour by hour, day by day.
Your memory will fade away.
Every sunrise, every sunset
Will help me to forget your name,
Your smile, your eyes
Medusa.

Decapitate her and bring her head to athena
Unlike her sisters, She ain't no deathless God.
This is for everytime you stabbed me in the back
For every notch in your bed post
This is for everytime you stabbed me in the back
For every notch in your bed post


9. 15 Fathoms & Counting

[Instrumental]


10. Off The Heezay

Off the heezay,
I've been taken from your arms
So many times I've felt this before.
The sheets are tangled
And they don't feel right on my carcass.
Like you do.

This is my revenge!
For every second sleep has stole
I feel dead
I feel dead inside.
I feel dead
I feel so fucking dead
I feel dead
I feel so dead!

Last night we dressed to our best,
And drank 'til there was nothing left.
I walked you home, you held my hand
We fucked away the rest of the night

Take my hand
For this is my revenge.
This is my revenge.
For every second lost.
This is my revenge!
This is my revenge!
This is my revenge!
This is my...
This is my revenge!
This is my...
(For every second)
Sleep has stole

And sweetie, I've got to say
That I'm really not worth the time of your day.
I guess when when we left each other for the first time
We didn't think goodbye would be our new favorite line.
